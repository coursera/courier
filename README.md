#### Why Courier?

Courier is the only comprehensive, schema based data system centered around JSON. Binary protocols, such as Protobuf and Thrift have proven that data schemas are an excellent way to share the structure of data messaged between multiple systems and programming languages. For JSON, however, there are few systems that take a schema driven approach and none that provide satisfactory type systems. Courier's solves this problem, providing a type safe, schema driven way of sharing JSON data between backends, web and mobile.
