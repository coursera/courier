Courier Runtime
---------------

The courier runtime project provides the Scala types needed at runtime.

It includes all classes needed by Courier generated scala bindings.

Pre-defined Types
-----------------

The runtime contains a number of pre defined types such as `IntMap` and `StringArray`.

By providing these common types available in the runtime, we avoid having to generate them, and,
additionally, there is guaranteed to only one implementation of each of these types.

These are generated by `org.coursera.courier.generator.TemplateGenerator.generatePredef`.

TODO: automate the generation of the predef classes.
