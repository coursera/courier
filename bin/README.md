# Courier Binary Distribution
The `courier` binary in this folder runs the last released version of courier from the command line,
generating into any of our target languages.

Usage ( if this PR gets merged ;) ):

```bash
curl \
  -o courier \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coursera/courier/master/bin/courier \
  && \
chmod +x courier \
  && \
./courier swift # java, ts, scala, etc.
```

This file is a small (12kb) distribution generated by the coincidentally named [Coursier](https://github.com/alexarchambault/coursier)
project (that's with an "s" in the middle). The binary will download all the dependencies it needs before its first run.

Of note:
  * The binary will only work on mac or linux.
  * The binary downloads a bunch of dependencies into the `/tmp/.courier/libs` folder
    the first time it is executed, so that will take some time.
    * *IMPLEMENTATION NOTE: This is kind of gross, but Coursier does not yet support specifying the user's home directory
      with its bootstrap workflow. It should be more like $HOME/.courier/libs*
  * The binary should be fast for every run after, unless `/tmp` gets cleared. In which case
    it will take a sec to run again.
  * In order to peg a version of courier, just curl the correct tag from
    this repository (replacing `master` in the usage string above with, e.g. `v0.0.4`).

## Publisher's Notes

Couple important things to know relative to publishing this binary:
  * The binary is generated by executing `sbt dist`, which performs a publishLocal then invokes coursier in
    the courier-cli project.
  * The binary should (eventually) be published in source control in the same commit that
    bumps `version.sbt` and gets tagged in git with a particular version.
  * If you have not already published to remote, then the binary will encode local file
    URLs for your jar dependency coordinates. A binary created with local file URLs can
    not be safely distributed, so this command should only ever be executed after a
    full publish, probably by travis (along with a version bump)
