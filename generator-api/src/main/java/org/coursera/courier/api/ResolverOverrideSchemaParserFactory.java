//
// In AbstractDataSchemaResolver.parse(), a resolver is able to create a parser that, in turn,
// only uses that particular resolver. This is problematic when using MultiFormatDataSchemaResolver
// because it allows the parser for a single file format (e.g. the resolver for ".pdsc" files)
// to only use the resolver for that file format when resolving schemas by name.
// As a result, a schema defined in a ".pdsc" references a schema defined in a ".courier" file
// (or vis-versa) can fail to resolve.
